# About Me
I’m a detail-oriented and results-driven Data Analyst with over two years of experience transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that empower smarter decisions.

With a passion for solving problems through data, I excel in using tools like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, Power BI, and Python to uncover trends, craft compelling visualizations, and streamline workflows through automation.

I thrive at the intersection of curiosity and strategy, consistently delivering data solutions that not only answer questions but also inspire new opportunities for growth.
